We are pleased to announce GiGaCoin, the coin of the Future!

We would like to position GiGaCoin as THE coin for Point of Sale transactions.
To this end, we have modified the source code to allow for an industry first: 

3 confirmations on all transactions!

Total Coins: 1.21Billion
Coins Per Block: 88

Qt GUI Wallet and Server Daemon precompiled for Windows 32/64bit.
Sourcecode available for all platforms.

We learned a LOT in the process of releasing a new coin.  Interested in a step by step alt coin creation guide?
We cover: psvTimestamp generation, genesishash creation and solving, replacement of the merkleroot , pnseed modification, pchmessagestart modification, pubScriptKey (master ECDSA keypairs) creation, initial blockhash checkpointing, and more!  We will also cover the compilation process in Windows and Linux for both the Qt GUI Client, and the Server Daemon.  We'll try to reply to any inquiry about the guide (make sure to mention the TxID of your donation) ASAP! This was the result of much time and effort, so if you are interested, please donate below:
